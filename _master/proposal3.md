Recent years have seen a surge of applicative successes using Reinforcement Learning (RL) [1] to solve challenging games and smaller domain problems [2][3][4]. These successes in RL have been achieved in part due to the strong collaborative effort by the RL community to work on common, open-sourced environment simulators such as OpenAI’s Gym [5] that allow for expedited development and valid comparisons between different, state-of-art strategies.
However many existing environments contain games rather than real-world problems. Only recent publications initiate the transition to application-oriented RL [6][7]. 

The aim of this thesis is to train a simple RL-based system on synthetic data (https://github.com/duckietown/gym-duckietown) and to deploy it on a toy car.

For this thesis, both low-level (eg. C) and high-level (Python) coding will be required.
