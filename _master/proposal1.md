Histopathological characterization of colorectal polyps allows to tailor patientsâ€™ management and follow up with the ultimate aim of avoiding or promptly detecting an invasive carcinoma. Colorectal polyps characterization relies on the histological analysis of tissue samples to determine the polyps malignancy and dysplasia grade. Deep neural networks achieve outstanding accuracy in medical patterns recognition, however they require large sets of annotated training images.

The aim of this thesis is to employ **generative models** (i.e GANs) for the generation of synthetic tissue patches and to assess the potential benefits when used in conjuction with real-world data, for predicting the dysplasia grade (*i.e. how likely the tissue is to develop into cancer*). The generation process will start from segmentation maps, in order to allow for finer control over the synthesized images.
