# Lung Nodule Segmentation

**<u>[Read the news on the DeepHealth newsletter](https://us4.campaign-archive.com/?u=34652ffcbee58fbd682ac9529&id=389e69fc8c)</u>**

On January 12th, 2021 at 15:00, Marco Grangetto together with the UNITO team (Marco Aldinucci, Barbara Cantalupo, Iacopo Colonnelli, Riccardo Renzulli, Enzo Tartaglione) presented the demo “Lung nodules segmentation in CT scans by DeepHealth toolkit” at ICPR2020.

The demo (https://www.micc.unifi.it/icpr2020/index.php/demos/), presented in the Session:  “Medical and Industrial Imaging”, showed how a Deep Learning pipeline, whose goal is to train a model to recognize lung nodules from chest CT scans, can be executed on the hybrid HPC-Cloud infrastructure. Specifically, the OpenDeepHealth infrastructure available at the University of Torino was presented, along with the usage of the Deep Learning libraries developed in the DeepHealth EU project.

ICPR2020 is the flagship conference of IAPR the International Association of Pattern Recognition and the premiere conference in pattern recognition, covering computer vision, image, sound, speech, sensor patterns processing and machine intelligence (https://www.micc.unifi.it/icpr2020/). The conference took place from 10 to 15 January 2021 and due to COVID-19, it was held entirely virtual using the UNDERLINE web platform. Only registered attendees could access the event.
