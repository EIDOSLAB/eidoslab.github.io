# DeepHealth project
Deep-Learning and HPC to Boost Biomedical Applications for Health (DeepHealth) project is funded by the EC under the topic ICT-11-2018-2019 “HPC and Big Data enabled Large-scale Test-beds and Applications”. DeepHealth is a 3-year project, kicked-off in mid January 2019 and is expected to conclude its work in December 2021. The aim of DeepHealth is to offer a unified framework completely adapted to exploit underlying heterogeneous HPC and Big Data architectures; and assembled with state-of-the-art techniques in Deep Learning and Computer Vision. In particular,the project will combine High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructures with Deep Learning (DL) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to support biomedical applications that require the analysis of large and complex biomedical datasets and thus, new and more efficient ways of diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of diseases.
